# Routing Rules for all our App Engine services.
# See: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/how-requests-are-routed#dispatch
#
# Using a dispatch.yaml config will let us create and mount other App Engine services in
# subdirectories.
#
# For example:
#
# - www.mysite.com      <- This will serve the "default" service (App Engine requires a "default").
# - www.mysite.com/api  <- This will serve the "api" service ("api" defined in "app/app.yaml").
# - www.mysite.com/blog <- You can even mount a blog (or forum) on the website.
#
# Note: The `dispatch.yaml` file needs to be deployed just like the `app.yaml` files.
#
# You can go back to traditional routing by following this doc:
#
#   https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/nodejs/reference/dispatch-yaml
#
dispatch:
  # Send API traffic to the "api" service.
  - url: "*/api/*"
    service: api

  # Send all non-specified traffice to the website.
  - url: "*/.*"
    service: default
